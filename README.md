# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023 in Rust.

## Why Rust?

Rust has a vibrant community with first-class developer experience, making it a solid language for serious work.

Some notable features of Rust include:

- A [large](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust?tab=Votes) [amount](https://crates.io/) of people that know the Rust programming language
- A [non-trivial](https://github.com/ferrocene/ferrocene) [amount](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app) of businesses that use Rust in production
- Excellent vim support with [rust.vim](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim) and [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
- [Incremental compilation](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/queries/incremental-compilation.html) support, a feature [lacking](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/incremental-compilation-exploration/5224) in other languages
- [One](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) universal library instead of [many](https://deno.land/api@v1.38.4) [competing](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bun-apis) [APIs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v21.x/docs/api/)

## Why Advent of Code

I like how the focus is solving problems instead of selling "Problems as a Service".

## Rules

- No `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`
- No `use` declarations
- No external crates
